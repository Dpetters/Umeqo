Trades are made throughout the world; the countries in which we have traded range from Vietnam, South Africa, and Ukraine to the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France. The Founder, President and Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Weiss, is an Emeritus Professor of economics who works closely with all WAM employees and interns. Our team includes people with advanced training in economics, computer science, physics, law, and mathematics, but we welcome applications from truly exceptional individuals with other backgrounds.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tAt Weiss Asset Management, we do things a little differently. We don&rsquo;t believe in hierarchy. New hires will work alongside the founder and CIO and other senior staff. They are often assisted by interns. We encourage questions and discussions. If you want to hide in an office, this is not the firm for you. If you want to be intellectually challenged by extremely able coworkers, you will enjoy working for us.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThe team is a group of exceptionally intelligent high achievers, whose academic backgrounds include economics, engineering, mathematics, physics, political science, computer science and law. Many of our professionals have degrees in two or more of these fields, and have earned graduate degrees from leading universities including Stanford, Caltech, MIT and Harvard. They rarely have backgrounds in finance.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tWeiss is looking for highly intelligent and self-motivated interns who want to work in an intellectually challenging environment. We are currently hiring top talent for paid part-time internships in operations, programming, and research. Interns work with analysts, traders, and software developers to research investments, support trading and settlement processes, develop in-house financial software, and maintain existing proprietary software. Interns may have an opportunity for full-time employment after graduation and will have tremendous growth potential, as they will be joining a small and growing team with a superb track record and great potential for continued future successes. Demonstrated, strong quantitative skills are required. Programming ability is a plus. Must be available at least 15 hours per week during the school year. Full-time availability during the winter break and summer vacation is a plus. &nbsp;Candidates should have experience and interest in econometrics, statistics, computer science, or other quantitative field.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n",
