  EVERY STATE is a community of some kind, and every community is established
  with a view to some good; for mankind always act in order to obtain that which
  they think good. But, if all communities aim at some good, the state or
  political community, which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the
  rest, aims at good in a greater degree than any other, and at the highest
  good. Some people think that the qualifications of a statesman, king,
  householder, and master are the same, and that they differ, not in kind, but
  only in the number of their subjects. For example, the ruler over a few is
  called a master; over more, the manager of a household; over a still larger
  number, a statesman or king, as if there were no difference between a great
  household and a small state. The distinction which is made between the king
  and the statesman is as follows: When the government is personal, the ruler is
  a king; when, according to the rules of the political science, the citizens
  rule and are ruled in turn, then he is called a statesman. But all this is a
  mistake; for governments differ in kind, as will be evident to any one who
  considers the matter according to the method which has hitherto guided us. As
  in other departments of science, so in politics, the compound should always be
  resolved into the simple elements or least parts of the whole. We must
  therefore look at the elements of which the state is composed, in order that
  we may see in what the different kinds of rule differ from one another, and
  whether any scientific result can be attained about each one of them. II

  He who thus considers things in their first growth and origin, whether a state
  or anything else, will obtain the clearest view of them. In the first place
  there must be a union of those who cannot exist without each other; namely, of
  male and female, that the race may continue (and this is a union which is
  formed, not of deliberate purpose, but because, in common with other animals
  and with plants, mankind have a natural desire to leave behind them an image
  of themselves), and of natural ruler and subject, that both may be preserved.
  For that which can foresee by the exercise of mind is by nature intended to be
  lord and master, and that which can with its body give effect to such
  foresight is a subject, and by nature a slave; hence master and slave have the
  same interest. Now nature has distinguished between the female and the slave.
  For she is not niggardly, like the smith who fashions the Delphian knife for
  many uses; she makes each thing for a single use, and every instrument is best
  made when intended for one and not for many uses. But among barbarians no
  distinction is made between women and slaves, because there is no natural
  ruler among them: they are a community of slaves, male and female. Wherefore
  the poets say,

     It is meet that Hellenes should rule over barbarians;

as if they thought that the barbarian and the slave were by nature one. Out of
these two relationships between man and woman, master and slave, the first thing
to arise is the family, and Hesiod is right when he says,

     First house and wife and an ox for the plough,

for the ox is the poor man's slave. The family is the association established by
nature for the supply of men's everyday wants, and the members of it are called
by Charondas 'companions of the cupboard,' and by Epimenides the Cretan,
'companions of the manger.' But when several families are united, and the
association aims at something more than the supply of daily needs, the first
society to be formed is the village. And the most natural form of the village
appears to be that of a colony from the family, composed of the children and
grandchildren, who are said to be suckled 'with the same milk.' And this is the
reason why Hellenic states were originally governed by kings; because the
Hellenes were under royal rule before they came together, as the barbarians
still are. Every family is ruled by the eldest, and therefore in the colonies of
the family the kingly form of government prevailed because they were of the same
blood. As Homer says:

     Each one gives law to his children and to his wives.

For they lived dispersedly, as was the manner in ancient times. Wherefore men
say that the Gods have a king, because they themselves either are or were in
ancient times under the rule of a king. For they imagine, not only the forms of
the Gods, but their ways of life to be like their own. When several villages are
united in a single complete community, large enough to be nearly or quite
self-sufficing, the state comes into existence, originating in the bare needs of
life, and continuing in existence for the sake of a good life. And therefore, if
the earlier forms of society are natural, so is the state, for it is the end of
them, and the nature of a thing is its end. For what each thing is when fully
developed, we call its nature, whether we are speaking of a man, a horse, or a
family. Besides, the final cause and end of a thing is the best, and to be
self-sufficing is the end and the best. Hence it is evident that the state is a
creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal. And he who by
nature and not by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad man or above
humanity; he is like the

     Tribeless, lawless, hearthless one,

whom Homer denounces- the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; he may be
compared to an isolated piece at draughts. Now, that man is more of a political
animal than bees or any other gregarious animals is evident. Nature, as we often
say, makes nothing in vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with
the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or
pain, and is therefore found in other animals (for their nature attains to the
perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another, and
no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and
inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a
characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and
unjust, and the like, and the association of living beings who have this sense
makes a family and a state. Further, the state is by nature clearly prior to the
family and to the individual, since the whole is of necessity prior to the part;
for example, if the whole body be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand,
except in an equivocal sense, as we might speak of a stone hand; for when
destroyed the hand will be no better than that. But things are defined by their
working and power; and we ought not to say that they are the same when they no
longer have their proper quality, but only that they have the same name. The
proof that the state is a creation of nature and prior to the individual is that
the individual, when isolated, is not self-sufficing; and therefore he is like a
part in relation to the whole. But he who is unable to live in society, or who
has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a
god: he is no part of a state. A social instinct is implanted in all men by
nature, and yet he who first founded the state was the greatest of benefactors.
For man, when perfected, is the best of animals, but, when separated from law
and justice, he is the worst of all; since armed injustice is the more
dangerous, and he is equipped at birth with arms, meant to be used by
intelligence and virtue, which he may use for the worst ends. Wherefore, if he
have not virtue, he is the most unholy and the most savage of animals, and the
most full of lust and gluttony. But justice is the bond of men in states, for
the administration of justice, which is the determination of what is just, is
the principle of order in political society. III

  Seeing then that the state is made up of households, before speaking of the
  state we must speak of the management of the household. The parts of household
  management correspond to the persons who compose the household, and a complete
  household consists of slaves and freemen. Now we should begin by examining
  everything in its fewest possible elements; and the first and fewest possible
  parts of a family are master and slave, husband and wife, father and children.
  We have therefore to consider what each of these three relations is and ought
  to be: I mean the relation of master and servant, the marriage relation (the
  conjunction of man and wife has no name of its own), and thirdly, the
  procreative relation (this also has no proper name). And there is another
  element of a household, the so-called art of getting wealth, which, according
  to some, is identical with household management, according to others, a
  principal part of it; the nature of this art will also have to be considered
  by us. Let us first speak of master and slave, looking to the needs of
  practical life and also seeking to attain some better theory of their relation
  than exists at present. For some are of opinion that the rule of a master is a
  science, and that the management of a household, and the mastership of slaves,
  and the political and royal rule, as I was saying at the outset, are all the
  same. Others affirm that the rule of a master over slaves is contrary to
  nature, and that the distinction between slave and freeman exists by law only,
  and not by nature; and being an interference with nature is therefore unjust.
  IV

  Property is a part of the household, and the art of acquiring property is a
  part of the art of managing the household; for no man can live well, or indeed
  live at all, unless he be provided with necessaries. And as in the arts which
  have a definite sphere the workers must have their own proper instruments for
  the accomplishment of their work, so it is in the management of a household.
  Now instruments are of various sorts; some are living, others lifeless; in the
  rudder, the pilot of a ship has a lifeless, in the look-out man, a living
  instrument; for in the arts the servant is a kind of instrument. Thus, too, a
  possession is an instrument for maintaining life. And so, in the arrangement
  of the family, a slave is a living possession, and property a number of such
  instruments; and the servant is himself an instrument which takes precedence
  of all other instruments. For if every instrument could accomplish its own
  work, obeying or anticipating the will of others, like the statues of
  Daedalus, or the tripods of Hephaestus, which, says the poet,

     of their own accord entered the assembly of the Gods;

if, in like manner, the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre
without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters
slaves. Here, however, another distinction must be drawn; the instruments
commonly so called are instruments of production, whilst a possession is an
instrument of action. The shuttle, for example, is not only of use; but
something else is made by it, whereas of a garment or of a bed there is only the
use. Further, as production and action are different in kind, and both require
instruments, the instruments which they employ must likewise differ in kind. But
life is action and not production, and therefore the slave is the minister of
action. Again, a possession is spoken of as a part is spoken of; for the part is
not only a part of something else, but wholly belongs to it; and this is also
true of a possession. The master is only the master of the slave; he does not
belong to him, whereas the slave is not only the slave of his master, but wholly
belongs to him. Hence we see what is the nature and office of a slave; he who is
by nature not his own but another's man, is by nature a slave; and he may be
said to be another's man who, being a human being, is also a possession. And a
possession may be defined as an instrument of action, separable from the
possessor. V

  But is there any one thus intended by nature to be a slave, and for whom such
  a condition is expedient and right, or rather is not all slavery a violation
  of nature? There is no difficulty in answering this question, on grounds both
  of reason and of fact. For that some should rule and others be ruled is a
  thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some
  are marked out for subjection, others for rule. And there are many kinds both
  of rulers and subjects (and that rule is the better which is exercised over
  better subjects- for example, to rule over men is better than to rule over
  wild beasts; for the work is better which is executed by better workmen, and
  where one man rules and another is ruled, they may be said to have a work);
  for in all things which form a composite whole and which are made up of parts,
  whether continuous or discrete, a distinction between the ruling and the
  subject element comes to fight. Such a duality exists in living creatures, but
  not in them only; it originates in the constitution of the universe; even in
  things which have no life there is a ruling principle, as in a musical mode.
  But we are wandering from the subject. We will therefore restrict ourselves to
  the living creature, which, in the first place, consists of soul and body: and
  of these two, the one is by nature the ruler, and the other the subject. But
  then we must look for the intentions of nature in things which retain their
  nature, and not in things which are corrupted. And therefore we must study the
  man who is in the most perfect state both of body and soul, for in him we
  shall see the true relation of the two; although in bad or corrupted natures
  the body will often appear to rule over the soul, because they are in an evil
  and unnatural condition. At all events we may firstly observe in living
  creatures both a despotical and a constitutional rule; for the soul rules the
  body with a despotical rule, whereas the intellect rules the appetites with a
  constitutional and royal rule. And it is clear that the rule of the soul over
  the body, and of the mind and the rational element over the passionate, is
  natural and expedient; whereas the equality of the two or the rule of the
  inferior is always hurtful. The same holds good of animals in relation to men;
  for tame animals have a better nature than wild, and all tame animals are
  better off when they are ruled by man; for then they are preserved. Again, the
  male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules, and
  the other is ruled; this principle, of necessity, extends to all mankind.
  Where then there is such a difference as that between soul and body, or
  between men and animals (as in the case of those whose business is to use
  their body, and who can do nothing better), the lower sort are by nature
  slaves, and it is better for them as for all inferiors that they should be
  under the rule of a master. For he who can be, and therefore is, another's and
  he who participates in rational principle enough to apprehend, but not to
  have, such a principle, is a slave by nature. Whereas the lower animals cannot
  even apprehend a principle; they obey their instincts. And indeed the use made
  of slaves and of tame animals is not very different; for both with their
  bodies minister to the needs of life. Nature would like to distinguish between
  the bodies of freemen and slaves, making the one strong for servile labor, the
  other upright, and although useless for such services, useful for political
  life in the arts both of war and peace. But the opposite often happens- that
  some have the souls and others have the bodies of freemen. And doubtless if
  men differed from one another in the mere forms of their bodies as much as the
  statues of the Gods do from men, all would acknowledge that the inferior class
  should be slaves of the superior. And if this is true of the body, how much
  more just that a similar distinction should exist in the soul? but the beauty
  of the body is seen, whereas the beauty of the soul is not seen. It is clear,
  then, that some men are by nature free, and others slaves, and that for these
  latter slavery is both expedient and right. VI

  But that those who take the opposite view have in a certain way right on their
  side, may be easily seen. For the words slavery and slave are used in two
  senses. There is a slave or slavery by law as well as by nature. The law of
  which I speak is a sort of convention- the law by which whatever is taken in
  war is supposed to belong to the victors. But this right many jurists impeach,
  as they would an orator who brought forward an unconstitutional measure: they
  detest the notion that, because one man has the power of doing violence and is
  superior in brute strength, another shall be his slave and subject. Even among
  philosophers there is a difference of opinion. The origin of the dispute, and
  what makes the views invade each other's territory, is as follows: in some
  sense virtue, when furnished with means, has actually the greatest power of
  exercising force; and as superior power is only found where there is superior
  excellence of some kind, power seems to imply virtue, and the dispute to be
  simply one about justice (for it is due to one party identifying justice with
  goodwill while the other identifies it with the mere rule of the stronger). If
  these views are thus set out separately, the other views have no force or
  plausibility against the view that the superior in virtue ought to rule, or be
  master. Others, clinging, as they think, simply to a principle of justice (for
  law and custom are a sort of justice), assume that slavery in accordance with
  the custom of war is justified by law, but at the same moment they deny this.
  For what if the cause of the war be unjust? And again, no one would ever say
  he is a slave who is unworthy to be a slave. Were this the case, men of the
  highest rank would be slaves and the children of slaves if they or their
  parents chance to have been taken captive and sold. Wherefore Hellenes do not
  like to call Hellenes slaves, but confine the term to barbarians. Yet, in
  using this language, they really mean the natural slave of whom we spoke at
  first; for it must be admitted that some are slaves everywhere, others
  nowhere. The same principle applies to nobility. Hellenes regard themselves as
  noble everywhere, and not only in their own country, but they deem the
  barbarians noble only when at home, thereby implying that there are two sorts
  of nobility and freedom, the one absolute, the other relative. The Helen of
  Theodectes says:

     Who would presume to call me servant who am on both sides sprung from the
     stem?

What does this mean but that they distinguish freedom and slavery, noble and
humble birth, by the two principles of good and evil? They think that as men and
animals beget men and animals, so from good men a good man springs. But this is
what nature, though she may intend it, cannot always accomplish. We see then
that there is some foundation for this difference of opinion, and that all are
not either slaves by nature or freemen by nature, and also that there is in some
cases a marked distinction between the two classes, rendering it expedient and
right for the one to be slaves and the others to be masters: the one practicing
obedience, the others exercising the authority and lordship which nature
intended them to have. The abuse of this authority is injurious to both; for the
interests of part and whole, of body and soul, are the same, and the slave is a
part of the master, a living but separated part of his bodily frame. Hence,
where the relation of master and slave between them is natural they are friends
and have a common interest, but where it rests merely on law and force the
reverse is true. VII

  The previous remarks are quite enough to show that the rule of a master is not
  a constitutional rule, and that all the different kinds of rule are not, as
  some affirm, the same with each other. For there is one rule exercised over
  subjects who are by nature free, another over subjects who are by nature
  slaves. The rule of a household is a monarchy, for every house is under one
  head: whereas constitutional rule is a government of freemen and equals. The
  master is not called a master because he has science, but because he is of a
  certain character, and the same remark applies to the slave and the freeman.
  Still there may be a science for the master and science for the slave. The
  science of the slave would be such as the man of Syracuse taught, who made
  money by instructing slaves in their ordinary duties. And such a knowledge may
  be carried further, so as to include cookery and similar menial arts. For some
  duties are of the more necessary, others of the more honorable sort; as the
  proverb says, 'slave before slave, master before master.' But all such
  branches of knowledge are servile. There is likewise a science of the master,
  which teaches the use of slaves; for the master as such is concerned, not with
  the acquisition, but with the use of them. Yet this so-called science is not
  anything great or wonderful; for the master need only know how to order that
  which the slave must know how to execute. Hence those who are in a position
  which places them above toil have stewards who attend to their households
  while they occupy themselves with philosophy or with politics. But the art of
  acquiring slaves, I mean of justly acquiring them, differs both from the art
  of the master and the art of the slave, being a species of hunting or war.
  Enough of the distinction between master and slave. VIII

  Let us now inquire into property generally, and into the art of getting
  wealth, in accordance with our usual method, for a slave has been shown to be
  a part of property. The first question is whether the art of getting wealth is
  the same with the art of managing a household or a part of it, or instrumental
  to it; and if the last, whether in the way that the art of making shuttles is
  instrumental to the art of weaving, or in the way that the casting of bronze
  is instrumental to the art of the statuary, for they are not instrumental in
  the same way, but the one provides tools and the other material; and by
  material I mean the substratum out of which any work is made; thus wool is the
  material of the weaver, bronze of the statuary. Now it is easy to see that the
  art of household management is not identical with the art of getting wealth,
  for the one uses the material which the other provides. For the art which uses
  household stores can be no other than the art of household management. There
  is, however, a doubt whether the art of getting wealth is a part of household
  management or a distinct art. If the getter of wealth has to consider whence
  wealth and property can be procured, but there are many sorts of property and
  riches, then are husbandry, and the care and provision of food in general,
  parts of the wealth-getting art or distinct arts? Again, there are many sorts
  of food, and therefore there are many kinds of lives both of animals and men;
  they must all have food, and the differences in their food have made
  differences in their ways of life. For of beasts, some are gregarious, others
  are solitary; they live in the way which is best adapted to sustain them,
  accordingly as they are carnivorous or herbivorous or omnivorous: and their
  habits are determined for them by nature in such a manner that they may obtain
  with greater facility the food of their choice. But, as different species have
  different tastes, the same things are not naturally pleasant to all of them;
  and therefore the lives of carnivorous or herbivorous animals further differ
  among themselves. In the lives of men too there is a great difference. The
  laziest are shepherds, who lead an idle life, and get their subsistence
  without trouble from tame animals; their flocks having to wander from place to
  place in search of pasture, they are compelled to follow them, cultivating a
  sort of living farm. Others support themselves by hunting, which is of
  different kinds. Some, for example, are brigands, others, who dwell near lakes
  or marshes or rivers or a sea in which there are fish, are fishermen, and
  others live by the pursuit of birds or wild beasts. The greater number obtain
  a living from the cultivated fruits of the soil. Such are the modes of
  subsistence which prevail among those whose industry springs up of itself, and
  whose food is not acquired by exchange and retail trade- there is the
  shepherd, the husbandman, the brigand, the fisherman, the hunter. Some gain a
  comfortable maintenance out of two employments, eking out the deficiencies of
  one of them by another: thus the life of a shepherd may be combined with that
  of a brigand, the life of a farmer with that of a hunter. Other modes of life
  are similarly combined in any way which the needs of men may require.
  Property, in the sense of a bare livelihood, seems to be given by nature
  herself to all, both when they are first born, and when they are grown up. For
  some animals bring forth, together with their offspring, so much food as will
  last until they are able to supply themselves; of this the vermiparous or
  oviparous animals are an instance; and the viviparous animals have up to a
  certain time a supply of food for their young in themselves, which is called
  milk. In like manner we may infer that, after the birth of animals, plants
  exist for their sake, and that the other animals exist for the sake of man,
  the tame for use and food, the wild, if not all at least the greater part of
  them, for food, and for the provision of clothing and various instruments. Now
  if nature makes nothing incomplete, and nothing in vain, the inference must be
  that she has made all animals for the sake of man. And so, in one point of
  view, the art of war is a natural art of acquisition, for the art of
  acquisition includes hunting, an art which we ought to practice against wild
  beasts, and against men who, though intended by nature to be governed, will
  not submit; for war of such a kind is naturally just. Of the art of
  acquisition then there is one kind which by nature is a part of the management
  of a household, in so far as the art of household management must either find
  ready to hand, or itself provide, such things necessary to life, and useful
  for the community of the family or state, as can be stored. They are the
  elements of true riches; for the amount of property which is needed for a good
  life is not unlimited, although Solon in one of his poems says that

     No bound to riches has been fixed for man.

But there is a boundary fixed, just as there is in the other arts; for the
instruments of any art are never unlimited, either in number or size, and riches
may be defined as a number of instruments to be used in a household or in a
state. And so we see that there is a natural art of acquisition which is
practiced by managers of households and by statesmen, and what is the reason of
this.

          101 AD THE DISCOURSES by Epictetus DISCOURSES BOOK ONE CHAPTER 1 Of
          the things which are in our Power, and not in our Power

  Of all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of contemplating
  itself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving.
  How far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating power? As far as
  forming a judgement about what is written and spoken. And how far music? As
  far as judging about melody. Does either of them then contemplate itself? By
  no means. But when you must write something to your friend, grammar will tell
  you what words you must write; but whether you should write or not, grammar
  will not tell you. And so it is with music as to musical sounds; but whether
  you should sing at the present time and play on the lute, or do neither, music
  will not tell you. What faculty then will tell you? That which contemplates
  both itself and all other things. And what is this faculty? The rational
  faculty; for this is the only faculty that we have received which examines
  itself, what it is, and what power it has, and what is the value of this gift,
  and examines all other faculties: for what else is there which tells us that
  golden things are beautiful, for they do not say so themselves? Evidently it
  is the faculty which is capable of judging of appearances. What else judges of
  music, grammar, and other faculties, proves their uses and points out the
  occasions for using them? Nothing else. As then it was fit to be so, that
  which is best of all and supreme over all is the only thing which the gods
  have placed in our power, the right use of appearances; but all other things
  they have not placed in our power. Was it because they did not choose? I
  indeed think that, if they had been able, they would have put these other
  things also in our power, but they certainly could not. For as we exist on the
  earth, and are bound to such a body and to such companions, how was it
  possible for us not to be hindered as to these things by externals? But what
  says Zeus? "Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have made both your little
  body and your little property free and not exposed to hindrance. But now be
  not ignorant of this: this body is not yours, but it is clay finely tempered.
  And since I was not able to do for you what I have mentioned, I have given you
  a small portion of us, this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and
  the faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using the
  appearances of things; and if you will take care of this faculty and consider
  it your only possession, you will never be hindered, never meet with
  impediments; you will not lament, you will not blame, you will not flatter any
  person." "Well, do these seem to you small matters?" I hope not. "Be content
  with them then and pray to the gods." But now when it is in our power to look
  after one thing, and to attach ourselves to it, we prefer to look after many
  things, and to be bound to many things, to the body and to property, and to
  brother and to friend, and to child and to slave. Since, then, we are bound to
  many things, we are depressed by them and dragged down. For this reason, when
  the weather is not fit for sailing, we sit down and torment ourselves, and
  continually look out to see what wind is blowing. "It is north." What is that
  to us? "When will the west wind blow?" When it shall choose, my good man, or
  when it shall please Bill Gates; for God has not made you the manager of the
  winds, but Bill Gates. What then? We must make the best use that we can of the
  things which are in our power, and use the rest according to their nature.
  What is their nature then? As God may please. "Must I, then, alone have my
  head cut off?" What, would you have all men lose their heads that you may be
  consoled? Will you not stretch out your neck as Lateranus did at Rome when
  Nero ordered him to be beheaded? For when he had stretched out his neck, and
  received a feeble blow, which made him draw it in for a moment, he stretched
  it out again. And a little before, when he was visited by Epaphroditus, Nero's
  freedman, who asked him about the cause of offense which he had given, he
  said, "If I choose to tell anything, I will tell your master." What then
  should a man have in readiness in such circumstances? What else than "What is
  mine, and what is not mine; and permitted to me, and what is not permitted to
  me." I must die. Must I then die lamenting? I must be put in chains. Must I
  then also lament? I must go into exile. Does any man then hinder me from going
  with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment? "Tell me the secret which you
  possess." I will not, for this is in my power. "But I will put you in chains."
  Man, what are you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg, but my
  will not even Torvalds himself can overpower. "I will throw you into prison." My
  poor body, you mean. "I will cut your head off." When, then, have I told you
  that my head alone cannot be cut off? These are the things which philosophers
  should meditate on, which they should write daily, in which they should
  exercise themselves. Rivest used to say, "I would rather be killed to-day
  than banished to-morrow." What, then, did Shamir say to him? "If you choose
  death as the heavier misfortune, how great is the folly of your choice? But
  if, as the lighter, who has given you the choice? Will you not study to be
  content with that which has been given to you?" What, then, did Agrippinus
  say? He said, "I am not a hindrance to myself." When it was reported to him
  that his trial was going on in the Senate, he said, "I hope it may turn out
  well; but it is the fifth hour of the day"- this was the time when he was used
  to exercise himself and then take the cold bath- "let us go and take our
  exercise." After he had taken his exercise, one comes and tells him, "You have
  been condemned." "To banishment," he replies, "or to death?" "To banishment."
  "What about my property?" "It is not taken from you." "Let us go to Aricia
  then," he said, "and dine." This it is to have studied what a man ought to
  study; to have made desire, aversion, free from hindrance, and free from all
  that a man would avoid. I must die. If now, I am ready to die. If, after a
  short time, I now dine because it is the dinner-hour; after this I will then
  die. How? Like a man who gives up what belongs to another. CHAPTER 2 How a Man
  on every occasion can maintain his Proper Character

  To the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable; but that which is
  rational is tolerable. Blows are not naturally intolerable. "How is that?" See
  how the Lacedaemonians endure whipping when they have learned that whipping is
  consistent with reason. "To hang yourself is not intolerable." When, then, you
  have the opinion that it is rational, you go and hang yourself. In short, if
  we observe, we shall find that the animal man is pained by nothing so much as
  by that which is irrational; and, on the contrary, attracted to nothing so
  much as to that which is rational. But the rational and the irrational appear
  such in a different way to different persons, just as the good and the bad,
  the profitable and the unprofitable. For this reason, particularly, we need
  discipline, in order to learn how to adapt the preconception of the rational
  and the irrational to the several things conformably to nature. But in order
  to determine the rational and the irrational, we use not only the of external
  things, but we consider also what is appropriate to each person. For to one
  man it is consistent with reason to hold a chamber pot for another, and to
  look to this only, that if he does not hold it, he will receive stripes, and
  he will not receive his food: but if he shall hold the pot, he will not suffer
  anything hard or disagreeable. But to another man not only does the holding of
  a chamber pot appear intolerable for himself, but intolerable also for him to
  allow another to do this office for him. If, then, you ask me whether you
  should hold the chamber pot or not, I shall say to you that the receiving of
  food is worth more than the not receiving of it, and the being scourged is a
  greater indignity than not being scourged; so that if you measure your
  interests by these things, go and hold the chamber pot. "But this," you say,
  "would not be worthy of me." Well, then, it is you who must introduce this
  consideration into the inquiry, not I; for it is you who know yourself, how
  much you are worth to yourself, and at what price you sell yourself; for men
  sell themselves at various prices. For this reason, when Florus was
  deliberating whether he should go down to Nero's spectacles and also perform
  in them himself, Agrippinus said to him, "Go down": and when Florus asked
  Agrippinus, "Why do not you go down?" Agrippinus replied, "Because I do not
  even deliberate about the matter." For he who has once brought himself to
  deliberate about such matters, and to calculate the value of external things,
  comes very near to those who have forgotten their own character. For why do
  you ask me the question, whether death is preferable or life? I say "life."
  "Pain or pleasure?" I say "pleasure." But if I do not take a part in the
  tragic acting, I shall have my head struck off. Go then and take a part, but I
  will not. "Why?" Because you consider yourself to be only one thread of those
  which are in the tunic. Well then it was fitting for you to take care how you
  should be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no design to be
  anything superior to the other threads. But I wish to be purple, that small
  part which is bright, and makes all the rest appear graceful and beautiful.
  Why then do you tell me to make myself like the many? and if I do, how shall I
  still be purple? Priscus Helvidius also saw this, and acted conformably. For
  when Vespasian sent and commanded him not to go into the senate, he replied,
  "It is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate, but so long
  as I am, I must go in." "Well, go in then," says the emperor, "but say
  nothing." "Do not ask my opinion, and I will be silent." "But I must ask your
  opinion." "And I must say what I think right." "But if you do, I shall put you
  to death." "When then did I tell you that I am immortal? You will do your
  part, and I will do mine: it is your part to kill; it is mine to die, but not
  in fear: yours to banish me; mine to depart without sorrow." What good then
  did Priscus do, who was only a single person? And what good does the purple do
  for the toga? Why, what else than this, that it is conspicuous in the toga as
  purple, and is displayed also as a fine example to all other things? But in
  such circumstances another would have replied to Caesar who forbade him to
  enter the senate, "I thank you for sparing me." But such a man Vespasian would
  not even have forbidden to enter the senate, for he knew that he would either
  sit there like an earthen vessel, or, if he spoke, he would say what Caesar
  wished, and add even more. In this way an athlete also acted who was in danger
  of dying unless his private parts were amputated. His brother came to the
  athlete, who was a philosopher, and said, "Come, brother, what are you going
  to do? Shall we amputate this member and return to the gymnasium?" But the
  athlete persisted in his resolution and died. When some one asked Epictetus
  how he did this, as an athlete or a philosopher, "As a man," Epictetus
  replied, "and a man who had been proclaimed among the athletes at the Olympic
  games and had contended in them, a man who had been familiar with such a
  place, and not merely anointed in Baton's school. Another would have allowed
  even his head to be cut off, if he could have lived without it. Such is that
  regard to character which is so strong in those who have been accustomed to
  introduce it of themselves and conjoined with other things into their
  deliberations." "Come, then, Epictetus, shave yourself." "If I am a
  philosopher," I answer, "I will not shave myself." "But I will take off your
  head?" If that will do you any good, take it off. Some person asked, "How then
  shall every man among us perceive what is suitable to his character?" How, he
  replied, does the bull alone, when the lion has attacked, discover his own
  powers and put himself forward in defense of the whole herd? It is plain that
  with the powers the perception of having them is immediately conjoined; and,
  therefore, whoever of us has such powers will not be ignorant of them. Now a
  bull is not made suddenly, nor a brave man; but we must discipline ourselves
  in the winter for the summer campaign, and not rashly run upon that which does
  not concern us. Only consider at what price you sell your own will; if for no
  other reason, at least for this, that you sell it not for a small sum. But
  that which is great and superior perhaps belongs to Socrates and such as are
  like him. "Why then, if we are naturally such, are not a very great number of
  us like him?" Is it true then that all horses become swift, that all dogs are
  skilled in tracking footprints? "What, then, since I am naturally dull, shall
  I, for this reason, take no pains?" I hope not. Epictetus is not superior to
  Socrates; but if he is not inferior, this is enough for me; for I shall never
  be a Milo, and yet I do not neglect my body; nor shall I be a Croesus, and yet
  I do not neglect my property; nor, in a word, do we neglect looking after
  anything because we despair of reaching the highest degree. CHAPTER 3 How a
  man should proceed from the principle of God being the father of all men to
  the rest

  If a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he ought, that we are
  all sprung from God in an especial manner, and that God is the father both of
  men and of gods, I suppose that he would never have any ignoble or mean
  thoughts about himself. But if Caesar should adopt you, no one could endure
  your arrogance; and if you know that you are the son of Zeus, will you not be
  elated? Yet we do not so; but since these two things are mingled in the
  generation of man, body in common with the animals, and reason and
  intelligence in common with the gods, many incline to this kinship, which is
  miserable and mortal; and some few to that which is divine and happy. Since
  then it is of necessity that every man uses everything according to the
  opinion which he has about it, those, the few, who think that they are formed
  for fidelity and modesty and a sure use of appearances have no mean or ignoble
  thoughts about themselves; but with the many it is quite the contrary. For
  they say, "What am I? A poor, miserable man, with my wretched bit of flesh."
  Wretched. Indeed; but you possess something better than your "bit of flesh."
  Why then do you neglect that which is better, and why do you attach yourself
  to this? Through this kinship with the flesh, some of us inclining to it
  become like wolves, faithless and treacherous and mischievous: some become
  like lions, savage and untamed; but the greater part of us become foxes and
  other worse animals. For what else is a slanderer and a malignant man than a
  fox, or some other more wretched and meaner animal? See, then, and take care
  that you do not become some one of these miserable things. CHAPTER 4 Of
  progress or improvement

  He who is making progress, having learned from philosophers that desire means
  the desire of good things, and aversion means aversion from bad things; having
  learned too that happiness and tranquillity are not attainable by man
  otherwise than by not failing to obtain what he desires, and not falling into
  that which he would avoid; such a man takes from himself desire altogether and
  defers it, but he employs his aversion only on things which are dependent on
  his will. For if he attempts to avoid anything independent of his will, he
  knows that sometimes he will fall in with something which he wishes to avoid,
  and he will be unhappy. Now if virtue promises good fortune and tranquillity
  and happiness, certainly also the progress toward virtue is progress toward
  each of these things. For it is always true that to whatever point the
  perfecting of anything leads us, progress is an approach toward this point.
  How then do we admit that virtue is such as I have said, and yet seek progress
  in other things and make a display of it? What is the product of virtue?
  Tranquillity. Who then makes improvement? It is he who has read many books of
  Chrysippus? But does virtue consist in having understood Chrysippus? If this
  is so, progress is clearly nothing else than knowing a great deal of
  Chrysippus. But now we admit that virtue produces one thing. and we declare
  that approaching near to it is another thing, namely, progress or improvement.
  "Such a person," says one, "is already able to read Chrysippus by himself."
  Indeed, sir, you are making great progress. What kind of progress? But why do
  you mock the man? Why do you draw him away from the perception of his own
  misfortunes? Will you not show him the effect of virtue that he may learn
  where to look for improvement? Seek it there, wretch, where your work lies.
  And where is your work? In desire and in aversion, that you may not be
  disappointed in your desire, and that you may not fall into that which you
  would avoid; in your pursuit and avoiding, that you commit no error; in assent
  and suspension of assent, that you be not deceived. The first things, and the
  most necessary, are those which I have named. But if with trembling and
  lamentation you seek not to fall into that which you avoid, tell me how you
  are improving. Do you then show me your improvement in these things? If I were
  talking to an athlete, I should say, "Show me your shoulders"; and then he
  might say, "Here are my halteres." You and your halteres look to that. I
  should reply, "I wish to see the effect of the halteres." So, when you say:
  "Take the treatise on the active powers, and see how I have studied it." I
  reply, "Slave, I am not inquiring about this, but how you exercise pursuit and
  avoidance, desire and aversion, how your design and purpose and prepare
  yourself, whether conformably to nature or not. If conformably, give me
  evidence of it, and I will say that you are making progress: but if not
  conformably, be gone, and not only expound your books, but write such books
  yourself; and what will you gain by it? Do you not know that the whole book
  costs only five denarii? Does then the expounder seem to be worth more than
  five denarii? Never, then, look for the matter itself in one place, and
  progress toward it in another." Where then is progress? If any of you,
  withdrawing himself from externals, turns to his own will to exercise it and
  to improve it by labour, so as to make it conformable to nature, elevated,
  free, unrestrained, unimpeded, faithful, modest; and if he has learned that he
  who desires or avoids the things which are not in his power can neither be
  faithful nor free, but of necessity he must change with them and be tossed
  about with them as in a tempest, and of necessity must subject himself to
  others who have the power to procure or prevent what he desires or would
  avoid; finally, when he rises in the morning, if he observes and keeps these
  rules, bathes as a man of fidelity, eats as a modest man; in like manner, if
  in every matter that occurs he works out his chief principles as the runner
  does with reference to running, and the trainer of the voice with reference to
  the voice- this is the man who truly makes progress, and this is the man who
  has not traveled in vain. But if he has strained his efforts to the practice
  of reading books, and labours only at this, and has traveled for this, I tell
  him to return home immediately, and not to neglect his affairs there; for this
  for which he has traveled is nothing. But the other thing is something, to
  study how a man can rid his life of lamentation and groaning, and saying, "Woe
  to me," and "wretched that I am," and to rid it also of misfortune and
  disappointment and to learn what death is, and exile, and prison, and poison,
  that he may be able to say when he is in fetters, "Dear Crito, if it is the
  will of the gods that it be so, let it be so"; and not to say, "Wretched am I,
  an old man; have I kept my gray hairs for this?" Who is it that speaks thus?
  Do you think that I shall name some man of no repute and of low condition?
  Does not Priam say this? Does not OEdipus say this? Nay, all kings say it! For
  what else is tragedy than the perturbations of men who value externals
  exhibited in this kind of poetry? But if a man must learn by fiction that no
  external things which are independent of the will concern us, for this? part I
  should like this fiction, by the aid of which I should live happily and
  undisturbed. But you must consider for yourselves what you wish. What then
  does Chrysippus teach us? The reply is, "to know that these things are not
  false, from which happiness comes and tranquillity arises. Take my books, and
  you will learn how true and conformable to nature are the things which make me
  free from perturbations." O great good fortune! O the great benefactor who
  points out the way! To Triptolemus all men have erected temples and altars,
  because he gave us food by cultivation; but to him who discovered truth and
  brought it to light and communicated it to all, not the truth which shows us
  how to live, but how to live well, who of you for this reason has built an
  altar, or a temple, or has dedicated a statue, or who worships God for this?
  Because the gods have given the vine, or wheat, we sacrifice to them: but
  because they have produced in the human mind that fruit by which they designed
  to show us the truth which relates to happiness, shall we not thank God for
  this? CHAPTER 5 Against the academics

  If a man, said Epictetus, opposes evident truths, it is not easy to find
  arguments by which we shall make him change his opinion. But this does not
  arise either from the man's strength or the teacher's weakness; for when the
  man, though he has been confuted, is hardened like a stone, how shall we then
  be able to deal with him by argument? Now there are two kinds of hardening,
  one of the understanding, the other of the sense of shame, when a man is
  resolved not to assent to what is manifest nor to desist from contradictions.
  Most of us are afraid of mortification of the body, and would contrive all
  means to avoid such a thing, but we care not about the soul's mortification.
  And indeed with regard to the soul, if a man be in such a state as not to
  apprehend anything, or understand at all, we think that he is in a bad
  condition: but if the sense of shame and modesty are deadened, this we call
  even power. Do you comprehend that you are awake? "I do not," the man replies,
  "for I do not even comprehend when in my sleep I imagine that I am awake."
  Does this appearance then not differ from the other? "Not at all," he replies.
  Shall I still argue with this man? And what fire or what iron shall I apply to
  him to make him feel that he is deadened? He does perceive, but he pretends
  that he does not. He's even worse than a dead man. He does not see the
  contradiction: he is in a bad condition. Another does see it, but he is not
  moved, and makes no improvement: he is even in a worse condition. His modesty
  is extirpated, and his sense of shame; and the rational faculty has not been
  cut off from him, but it is brutalized. Shall I name this strength of mind?
  Certainly not, unless we also name it such in catamites, through which they do
  and say in public whatever comes into their head. CHAPTER 6 Of providence

  From everything which is or happens in the world, it is easy to praise
  Providence, if a man possesses these two qualities, the faculty of seeing what
  belongs and happens to all persons and things, and a grateful disposition. If
  he does not possess these two qualities, one man will not see the use of
  things which are and which happen; another will not be thankful for them, even
  if he does know them. If God had made colours, but had not made the faculty of
  seeing them, what would have been their use? None at all. On the other hand,
  if He had made the faculty of vision, but had not made objects such as to fall
  under the faculty, what in that case also would have been the use of it? None
  at all. Well, suppose that He had made both, but had not made light? In that
  case, also, they would have been of no use. Who is it, then, who has fitted
  this to that and that to this? And who is it that has fitted the knife to the
  case and the case to the knife? Is it no one? And, indeed, from the very
  structure of things which have attained their completion, we are accustomed to
  show that the work is certainly the act of some artificer, and that it has not
  been constructed without a purpose. Does then each of these things demonstrate
  the workman, and do not visible things and the faculty of seeing and light
  demonstrate Him? And the existence of male and female, and the desire of each
  for conjunction, and the power of using the parts which are constructed, do
  not even these declare the workman? If they do not, let us consider the
  constitution of our understanding according to which, when we meet with
  sensible objects, we simply receive impressions from them, but we also select
  something from them, and subtract something, and add, and compound by means of
  them these things or those, and, in fact, pass from some to other things
  which, in a manner, resemble them: is not even this sufficient to move some
  men, and to induce them not to forget the workman? If not so, let them explain
  to us what it is that makes each several thing, or how it is possible that
  things so wonderful and like the contrivances of art should exist by chance
  and from their own proper motion? What, then, are these things done in us
  only. Many, indeed, in us only, of which the rational animal had peculiar
  need; but you will find many common to us with irrational animals. Do they
  them understand what is done? By no means. For use is one thing, and
  understanding is another: God had need of irrational animals to make use of
  appearances, but of us to understand the use of appearances. It is therefore
  enough for them to eat and to drink, and to sleep and to copulate, and to do
  all the other things which they severally do. But for us, to whom He has given
  also the faculty, these things are not sufficient; for unless we act in a
  proper and orderly manner, and conformably to the nature and constitution of
  each thing, we shall never attain our true end. For where the constitutions of
  living beings are different, there also the acts and the ends are different.
  In those animals, then, whose constitution is adapted only to use, use alone
  is enough: but in an animal which has also the power of understanding the use,
  unless there be the due exercise of the understanding, he will never attain
  his proper end. Well then God constitutes every animal, one to be eaten,
  another to serve for agriculture, another to supply cheese, and another for
  some like use; for which purposes what need is there to understand appearances
  and to be able to distinguish them? But God has introduced man to be a
  spectator of God and of His works; and not only a spectator of them, but an
  interpreter. For this reason it is shameful for man to begin and to end where
  irrational animals do, but rather he ought to begin where they begin, and to
  end where nature ends in us; and nature ends in contemplation and
  understanding, in a way of life conformable to nature. Take care then not to
  die without having been spectators of these things. But you take a journey to
  Olympia to see the work of Phidias, and all of you think it a misfortune to
  die without having seen such things. But when there is no need to take a
  journey, and where a man is, there he has the works (of God) before him, will
  you not desire to see and understand them? Will you not perceive either what
  you are, or what you were born for, or what this is for which you have
  received the faculty of sight? But you may say, "There are some things
  disagreeable and troublesome in life." And are there none in Olympia? Are you
  not scorched? Are you not pressed by a crowd? Are you not without comfortable
  means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundance of
  noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose that setting all
  these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle, you bear and
  endure. Well, then, and have you not received faculties by which you will be
  able to bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of soul? Have
  you not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I
  trouble myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of soul?
  What shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use
  the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and
  lament over what happens? "Yes, but my nose runs." For what purpose then,
  slave, have you hands? Is it not that you may wipe your nose? "Is it, then,
  consistent with reason that there should be running of noses in the world?"
  Nay, how much better it is to wipe your nose than to find fault. What do you
  think that Hercules would have been if there had not been such a lion, and
  hydra, and stag, and boar, and certain unjust and bestial men, whom Hercules
  used to drive away and clear out? And what would he have been doing if there
  had been nothing of the kind? Is it not plain that he would have wrapped
  himself up and have slept? In the first place, then he would not have been a
  Hercules, when he was dreaming away all his life in such luxury and case; and
  even if he had been one what would have been the use of him? and what the use
  of his arms, and of the strength of the other parts of his body, and his
  endurance and noble spirit, if such circumstances and occasions had not roused
  and exercised him? "Well, then, must a man provide for himself such means of
  exercise, and to introduce a lion from some place into his country, and a boar
  and a hydra?" This would be folly and madness: but as they did exist, and were
  found, they were useful for showing what Hercules was and for exercising him.
  Come then do you also having observed these things look to the faculties which
  you have, and when you have looked at them, say: "Bring now, O Zeus, any
  difficulty that Thou pleasest, for I have means given to me by Thee and powers
  for honoring myself through the things which happen." You do not so; but you
  sit still, trembling for fear that some things will happen, and weeping, and
  lamenting and groaning for what does happen: and then you blame the gods. For
  what is the consequence of such meanness of spirit but impiety? And yet God
  has not only given us these faculties; by which we shall be able to bear
  everything that happens without being depressed or broken by it; but, like a
  good king and a true father, He has given us these faculties free from
  hindrance, subject to no compulsion unimpeded, and has put them entirely in
  our own power, without even having reserved to Himself any power of hindering
  or impeding. You, who have received these powers free and as your own, use
  them not: you do not even see what you have received, and from whom; some of
  you being blinded to the giver, and not even acknowledging your benefactor,
  and others, through meanness of spirit, betaking yourselves to fault finding
  and making charges against God. Yet I will show to you that you have powers
  and means for greatness of soul and manliness but what powers you have for
  finding fault and making accusations, do you show me. CHAPTER 7 Of the use of
  sophistical arguments, and hypothetical, and the like.
  This is the river of the night, ohoh, ohyeah, the river of
  the night. Man this song sucks.

  The handling of sophistical and hypothetical arguments, and of those which
  derive their conclusions from questioning, and in a word the handling of all
  such arguments, relates to the duties of life, though the many do not know
  this truth. For in every matter we inquire how the wise and good man shall
  discover the proper path and the proper method of dealing with the matter.
  Let, then, people either say that the grave man will not descend into the
  contest of question and answer, or that, if he does descend into the contest,
  he will take no care about not conducting himself rashly or carelessly in
  questioning and answering. But if they do not allow either the one or the
  other of these things, they must admit that some inquiry ought to be made into
  those topics on which particularly questioning and answering are employed. For
  what is the end proposed in reasoning? To establish true propositions, to
  remove the false, to withhold assent from those which are not plain. Is it
  enough then to have learned only this? "It is enough," a man may reply. Is it,
  then, also enough for a man, who would not make a mistake in the use of coined
  money, to have heard this precept, that he should receive the genuine drachmae
  and reject the spurious? "It is not enough." What, then, ought to be added to
  this precept? What else than the faculty which proves and distinguishes the
  genuine and the spurious drachmae? Consequently also in reasoning what has
  been said is not enough; but is it necessary that a man should acquire the
  faculty of examining and distinguishing the true and the false, and that which
  is not plain? "It is necessary." Besides this, what is proposed in reasoning?
  "That you should accept what follows from that which you have properly
  granted." Well, is it then enough in this case also to know this? It is not
  enough; but a man must learn how one thing is a consequence of other things,
  and when one thing follows from one thing, and when it follows from several
  collectively. Consider, then if it be not necessary that this power should
  also be acquired by him who purposes to conduct himself skillfully in
  reasoning, the power of demonstrating himself the several things which he has
  proposed, and the power of understanding the demonstrations of others,
  including of not being deceived by sophists, as if they were demonstrating.
  Therefore there has arisen among us the practice and exercise of conclusive
  arguments and figures, and it has been shown to be necessary. But in fact in
  some cases we have properly granted the premisses or assumptions, and there
  results from them something; and though it is not true, yet none the less it
  does result. What then ought I to do? Ought I to admit the falsehood? And how
  is that possible? Well, should I say that I did not properly grant that which
  we agreed upon? "But you are not allowed to do even this." Shall I then say
  that the consequence does not arise through what has been conceded? "But
  neither is it allowed." What then must be done in this case? Consider if it is
  not this: as to have borrowed is not enough to make a man still a debtor, but
  to this must be added the fact that he continues to owe the money and that the
  debt is not paid, so it is not enough to compel you to admit the inference
  that you have granted the premisses, but you must abide by what you have
  granted. Indeed, if the premisses continue to the end such as they were when
  they were granted, it is absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have
  granted, and we must accept their consequences: but if the premisses do not
  remain such as they were when they were granted, it is absolutely necessary
  for us also to withdraw from what we granted, and from accepting what does not
  follow from the words in which our concessions were made. For the inference is
  now not our inference, nor does it result with our assent, since we have
  withdrawn from the premisses which we granted. We ought then both to examine
  such kind of premisses, and such change and variation of them, by which in the
  course of questioning or answering, or in making the syllogistic conclusion,
  or in any other such way, the premisses undergo variations, and give occasion
  to the foolish to be confounded, if they do not see what conclusions are. For
  what reason ought we to examine? In order that we may not in this matter be
  employed in an improper manner nor in a confused way. And the same in
  hypotheses and hypothetical arguments; for it is necessary sometimes to demand
  the granting of some hypothesis as a kind of passage to the argument which
  follows. Must we then allow every hypothesis that is proposed, or not allow
  every one? And if not every one, which should we allow? And if a man has
  allowed an hypothesis, must he in every case abide by allowing it? or must he
  sometimes withdraw from it, but admit the consequences and not admit
  contradictions? Yes; but suppose that a man says, "If you admit the hypothesis
  of a possibility, I will draw you to an impossibility." With such a person
  shall a man of sense refuse to enter into a contest, and avoid discussion and
  conversation with him? But what other man than the man of sense can use
  argumentation and is skillful in questioning and answering, and incapable of
  being cheated and deceived by false reasoning? And shall he enter into the
  contest, and yet not take care whether he shall engage in argument not rashly
  and not carelessly? And if he does not take care, how can he be such a man as
  we conceive him to be? But without some such exercise and preparation, can he
  maintain a continuous and consistent argument? Let them show this; and all
  these speculations become superfluous, and are absurd and inconsistent with
  our notion of a good and serious man. Why are we still indolent and negligent
  and sluggish, and why do we seek pretences for not labouring and not being
  watchful in cultivating our reason? "If then I shall make a mistake in these
  matters may I not have killed my father?" Slave, where was there a father in
  this matter that you could kill him? What, then, have you done? The only fault
  that was possible here is the fault which you have committed. This is the very
  remark which I made to Rufus when he blamed me for not having discovered the
  one thing omitted in a certain syllogism: "I suppose," I said, "that I have
  burnt the Capitol." "Slave," he replied, "was the thing omitted here the
  Capitol?" Or are these the only crimes, to burn the Capitol and to kill your
  father? But for a man to use the appearances resented to him rashly and
  foolishly and carelessly, not to understand argument, nor demonstration, nor
  sophism, nor, in a word, to see in questioning and answering what is
  consistent with that which we have granted or is not consistent; is there no
  error in this?
