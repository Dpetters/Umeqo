    <h3>What is Umeqo?</h3>
    <p>Umeqo is a recruiting resource meant to help students and employers discover one another. By streamlining the familiar paradigms of resumes and events, we are looking to save both parties time and effort.</p>  
    <h3>Why was Umeqo created?</h3>
    <p>Umeqo was created by current <a href="http://mit.edu/">MIT</a> and <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> undergraduates to fix the pains of college recruiting. We were frustrated about missing recruiting events because we didnâ€™t hear about them and having to drop our resumes in a gazillion different places. Building on our experiences helping employers recruit, we thus developed Umeqo to solve these problems.</p>
    <h3>What lies ahead?</h3>
    <p>With the Beta released to MIT students, campus organizations, and employers, we are busy garnening feedback, adding new features, and tweaking things here and there. With student and recruiter support, we hope that Umeqo becomes the de-facto standard event management and student discovery tool here at MIT and beyond.</p>
    <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
    <p>If you are an employer, support us by <a href="{% url subscriptions %}">subscribing</a>. If you're an MIT student, <a href="{% url student_registration %}">signup</a> and let us know of any feedback you have. If you are a student at another univesity, <a href="#" class="open_contact_us_dialog_link">contact us</a> and tell us where you are from! </p>
