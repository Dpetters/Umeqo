    <h3>What is Umeqo?</h3>
    <p>Umeqo is a new faster and smarter way for recruiters to find potential student candidates. Our mission is to make campus recruiting simpler and less time consuming for all three parties involved - recruiters, career offices, and students..</p>  
    <h3>Why was Umeqo created?</h3>
    <p>Umeqo was built by a group of students from <a href="http://mit.edu/">MIT</a> and <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> who experienced the deficiencies with the way campus recruiting is done now firsthand and decided to do something about it. We are actively working alongside career offices, recruiters, and students to build the fast, smart, and easy-to-use recruiting platform that they deserve.</p>
    <h3>Can I use it?</h3>
    <p>If you are an employer, you can request a free account <a href="{% url subscriptions %}">here</a> (we just need to check that you're a real employer). If you are an MIT student, <a href="{% url student_registration %}">signup</a> and let us know of any feedback you have. If you are a student at another univesity, <a href="#" class="open_contact_us_dialog_link">contact us</a> and tell us where you are from and whether you'd like to see Umeqo come to your school! </p>
