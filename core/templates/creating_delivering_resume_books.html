<p class="header"><span class="num">Step 7:</span> Download your resume book or email it to one or more email addresses.</p>

<p>Select "email" as the delivery type to email the resume book to one or more email addresses.</p>

{% block things_to_note %}
<p>1. There is a 50 student limit on any single resume book. If an event RSVP or attendee list which you wish to turn into a resume book has more students than that, consider filtering it down to less than 50 students. Alternatively you can <a href="{% url tutorial slug='browsing-attendees-rsvps' %}#export">export the names and emails of those studens</a>.</p>
<p>2. Not every student has a Umeqo account, so the attendee count may be higher than the number of results. Those who are not have already received an email telling them that {% if user.recruiter %}{{user.recruiter.employer}}{% else %}you{% endif %} can only see their name and email until they register.</p>
<p>2. If you delete a past resume book, it cannot be recovered. </p>
