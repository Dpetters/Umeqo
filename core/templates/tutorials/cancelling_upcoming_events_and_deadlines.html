{% block things_to_note %}
<li>All RSVPs or participants of the event or deadline (respectively) which you cancel will be emailed, notifying them of the cancellation.</li>
<li>If you wish to change the time or date of an event, never cancel the existing one and create a new one. RSVPs will be notified of the cancellation and will assume that the event or deadline is no longer happening. Instead, simply edit the event.</li>

{% block tips_and_tricks %}
<li>We will soon allow you to re-create events based off of past and cancelled ones.</li>
