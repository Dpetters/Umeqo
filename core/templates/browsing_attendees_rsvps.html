{% block things_to_note %}
<p>1. If you <a href="#filter">filter by an attribute</a> which a student has not yet filled out, that student will not appear in the results. e.g. If you filter for students with an SAT of 2000 or above, any student who hasn't specified his/her SAT will not appear in the results.</p>
<p>2. If you have a free trial subscription, then you will only be able to <a href="{% url tutorial slug='browsing-attendees-rsvps' %}">search and browse your events' RSVPs and attendees</a>.</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block tips_and_tricks %}
<p>1. The easiest way to share your observations and notes about students is to <a href="#comment">comment</a> on their profiles and then {% if user.recruiter %}<a href="{% url employer_account %}?action=new_recruiter_credentials">create credentials</a>{% else %}create credentials{% endif %} for your fellow co-workers. All users from your firm will see each other's comments and any students that one stars will also appear starred to everybody else.</p>
