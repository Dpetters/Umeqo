    "description" : "Epsilon Theta is a co-ed MIT fraternity made up of about twenty men and women. Living together as a family of brothers and sisters, we consider ourselves a \"fraternity\" in the true sense of the word. Our big yellow house in Brookline is surrounded by tree-filled parks and a quiet residential community. Here we come home to unwind after a day of attending classes and working on campus. Epsilon Theta is a great place to study, play games, and build friendships."
