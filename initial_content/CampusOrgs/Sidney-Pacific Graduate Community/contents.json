    "description" : "The vibrant community at Sidney-Pacific is what makes S-P more -- much more! -- than just another residence hall. Here at S-P, nearly 700 graduate students of diverse backgrounds and interests come together. Everyone has a story to tell, everyone has a talent to share, and our residential life programs strive to provide the perfect environment for that sharing and telling to happen. Indeed, the primary goal of our hardworking house government and friendly housemasters is to encourage residents to build friendships, get to know neighbors, and ultimately have a wonderful time here."
