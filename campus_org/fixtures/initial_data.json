   "description": "6.270 is a hands-on, learn-by-doing class open only to MIT students, in which participants design and build a robot that will play in a competition at the end of January. The goal for the students is to design a machine that will be able to navigate its way around the playing surface, recognize other opponents, and manipulate game objects. Unlike the machines in Introduction to Design (formerly 2.70, now 2.007), 6.270 robots are totally autonomous, so once a round begins, there is no human intervention (in 2.007 the machines are controlled with joysticks).\r\n\r\nThe goal of 6.270 is to teach students about robotic design by giving them the hardware, software, and information they need to design, build, and debug their own robot. The subject includes concepts and applications that are related to various MIT classes (e.g. 6.00, 6.01, 6.02, 6.002, 6.004, and 2.007), though there are no formal prerequisites for 6.270. We've found that people can learn everything they need to know by working with each other, being introduced to some material in class, and mostly, by hacking on their robots.\r\n\r\nThe students work in teams of two or three. Each team is given the same kit containing various sensors, electronic components, batteries, motors, and LEGO. The kits are handed out in the beginning of January and they have three weeks in which to transform the parts into a working robot.",

Most of their dances are either self-choreographed or adapted from award-winning pieces in China's dance competitions; there's something for every member of every level of experience!\r\n\r\nAs a cultural group on campus, ADT hopes to express the grace, power, and diversity of these various East Asian artforms through their two grand showcases each year - one in the winter and one in the spring - to show off how much we've grown during the year. Each showcase is comprised of 15-20 dances, oftentimes with guest performances by other East Asian groups such as acapella group Syncopasian or the Chinese Ensemble. In addition to these showcases, they also perform at various events and gatherings within MIT and the Greater Boston community, such as Nightmarket and Lunar New Year celebrations.",

The Concert Choir works to create an environment where student singers can learn, perform, and contribute to the MIT musical community. By bringing together singers in a social, academic, and performance atmosphere, they hope to expose the MIT community to a wide range of choral music literature and history. \r\n\r\nAs MIT's large student chorus, the Concert Choir performs major works from the standard repertoire each semester, as well as a variety of shorter and lesser-known pieces. The Choir has a rich history originating with the all-male Glee Club in 1884 and continuing with the MIT Choral Society from 1923 until the formation of the Concert Choir under John Oliver in 1989. William Cutter, who came to MIT in 1990 as John Oliver's assistant and rehearsal pianist, assumed the direction of MIT's choral program upon Mr. Oliver's departure in 1996.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the Concert Choir has toured in Budapest, Vienna, and Lausanne, and performed in numerous collaborations with the smaller MIT Chamber Chorus, the MIT Symphony Orchestra, the MIT Wind Ensemble, the choirs of Brown, Tufts and Brandeis Universities, and the orchestras of Tufts University and Wellesley College. In 2002, the MIT Concert Choir was invited to perform with the Boston Pops under Keith Lockhart for MIT's Tech Night at the Pops. Often featuring the finest guest soloists along with student soloists, the student singers of the group regularly expose the MIT community to a wide range of choral music literature.",

They also have a downhill ski weekend in January and a cross-country ski trip in February. In March they pay a visit to the Big Apple (New York). On Memorial Day weekend in May, they drive to Maine or upstate New York for white-water rafting.

In addition, MITFC maintains a library of navigational and instructional materials. Several textbooks, a headset, U.S. sectionals, and airport facility directories are available for members to borrow. While based at MIT, club membership is open to everyone.\r\n\r\nA \u201cloggable\u201d flight simulator is being readied for use by the end of the semester. In addition, MITFC will be holding a flying trip to Cape Cod this April. For more information about the club\u2019s upcoming events, and how to get into powered and unpowered flight, download the Powerpoint Presentation.\r\n\r\nThe MIT Flying Club is organized by the MIT Flying Club Executive Board.",

The Hillel student body is composed of people from all over the country and the world.\r\n\r\nSocial events, community service, and Jewish learning opportunities are highlights of the Hillel program throughout the year. Hillel's test tube menorah and (now-retired) award-winning student designed sukkah are two examples of the unique community on campus. Hillel's reach expands into the dormitories, fraternities, sororities, with events often being hosted by different Jewish networked-groups. Since graduate students comprise more than half of the MIT student population, Grad Hillel schedules its own diverse events. Our annual Latke-Hamentaschen Debate and nationally-reported-upon Hummus Experience gather students from across campus life. Hillel's Independent Activities Period program, during MIT's four week January term devoted to alternative learning, offers many unique events and classes.\r\n\r\nOther groups such as MIT Students for Israel, the Jewish a cappella ensemble Techiya, and Sloan Jewish Student Organization are active on campus. Hillel also sponsors Art exhibits, a monthly dinner with professors, and a speaker series. Greater Boston is an academic and cultural center attracting thousands of Jewish students to area colleges.

We offer our audience an opportunity to broaden their perspectives by actively considering imminent issues in medicine.\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with the Harvard Hippocratic Society, we realize our objectives by organizing formal conferences and symposia, as well as by hosting informal small-group discussions, both of which provide dynamic forums for participation, discussion, and learning. Additionally, we produce a biannual Journal of the Hippocratic Society, a multidisciplinary publication that likewise highlights the inter-dependence of medicine and other fields.

The role of the Interfraternity Council executive board is to create proper programming and protocol in order to ensure that our purpose as an organization comes to fruition.\r\nOne of our main goals is to promote interfraternal relations and we do this by creating programming such Greek Week in the spring and the President-Faculty Dinner in the fall. Outside of our IFC Meetings, which mainly involve presidents from every fraternity, we also have a Delegate's Council where we talk about organizational commonalities amongst the fraternities which each person can use to improve their own fraternity.\r\n\r\nAs an organization, we are very structured and have various documents that outline our goals and rules. We have our Constitution that outlines the reason behind our existence as an organization and three main documents that are followed by all our constituents: the Judicial Committee Bylaws, the Recruitment Rules, and the Risk Management Policy.",

To increase awareness of genocide in the Sudan among the student community at MIT via featured events on campus \r\n2.

The organization was launched by graduate students studying science and engineering at universities in the United States with the desire to answer the question, \"how can science and engineering students change the global community.\" The founders recognized the importance of multicultural and interdisciplinary perspectives in addressing contemporary global issues, and became motivated to establish a network where we, the young generation, can exchange ideas on where we can lead the global society and how we individual can contribute to the needs of society's leadership. We then build on that network to take the first steps towards local and global action.",

   "description": "The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, CA in 1974 by a group of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic community. The concept of networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside the Unites States.\r\n\r\nThe MIT chapter was established in 1987.  Since then, it has grown to over 60 active and 100 general members. Members do not have to be Hispanic or engineering students to participate.  They offer a broad range of opportunities to our members from networking and job opportunities with industry to assistance in the graduate school application process.  They also seek to help others in our community by mentoring middle school school students through the STEM program and encouraging them to pursue higher education, and through other community service work in the greater Boston area.",

The club was founded with two very important agendas in mind: to provide continued support and training for those already experienced in Taekwondo, and also to introduce and teach the martial art to those who had never tried it before.\r\n\r\nThe club has since exploded in popularity and competitive success, winning the Overall Collegiate National Championship 4 years later, along with 4 consecutive Ivy/Northeast Collegiate Taekwondo League championships. It has become a thriving community of over 50 teamates, athletes and friends... and it's still growing.

Both are certified Table Tennis coaches. Coach Liang handles the training of club members while Coach Carlos handles the training of the intercollegiate team. They are assisted by Coach Alex Landsman.\r\n\r\nThe club offers members 14 quality Butterfly Europa Tables that are in very good condition. In addition, a large number of balls and rackets are available for practice although we do encourage members to bring their own rackets to practice. The club also has a 'Robo Pong' robot to help with team practice sessions.\r\n\r\nThe MIT team has done very well at the divisional level over the last couple of years, coming in at 3rd place both years. Team practices are held three times a week and consist of various drills and excercises along with 'one on one' coaching with our team coach Carlos. The club has open practice sessions twice a week which we encourage members to take advantage of. \r\n\r\nEvery Saturday, the club holds an internal tournament which is open to all members. It is held in a Knockout format with the winner receiving a Club Prize (a club T-shirt, Paddle, etc). Each participant gets a certain number of points from each tournament depending on their performance.  At the end of each semester, the person with the most number of points is felicitated.",

Each year, Tau Beta Pi donates thousands of dollars to the Museum of Science to allow all MIT students enter the museum for free. Tau Beta Pi also organizes the Spring Career Fair that typically occurs during the first week of classes in February to help MIT students and alumni find jobs and internships. Service projects such as SciPro, TBP teach, and Project Fund (TBP Fellowship) are supported by Tau Beta Pi as well.",
