   "description": "6.270 is a hands-on, learn-by-doing class open only to MIT students, in which participants design and build a robot that will play in a competition at the end of January. The goal for the students is to design a machine that will be able to navigate its way around the playing surface, recognize other opponents, and manipulate game objects. Unlike the machines in Introduction to Design (formerly 2.70, now 2.007), 6.270 robots are totally autonomous, so once a round begins, there is no human intervention (in 2.007 the machines are controlled with joysticks).\r\n\r\nThe goal of 6.270 is to teach students about robotic design by giving them the hardware, software, and information they need to design, build, and debug their own robot. The subject includes concepts and applications that are related to various MIT classes (e.g. 6.00, 6.01, 6.02, 6.002, 6.004, and 2.007), though there are no formal prerequisites for 6.270. We've found that people can learn everything they need to know by working with each other, being introduced to some material in class, and mostly, by hacking on their robots.\r\n\r\nThe students work in teams of two or three. Each team is given the same kit containing various sensors, electronic components, batteries, motors, and LEGO. The kits are handed out in the beginning of January and they have three weeks in which to transform the parts into a working robot.",

   "description": "Alpha Epsilon Phi is a national sorority, founded in 1909 by seven Jewish women, dedicated to helping women become the best they can be. We prize individuality, encouraging each member to discover and develop the talents and abilities that make her unique.\r\n\r\nBut just as we value individuality, we also prize togetherness, fostering friendships and a sense of belonging that last a lifetime. When you\u2019re an AE?, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s always a sister to laugh when you laugh, to listen when you talk, to lend a hand and be there for you.\r\n\r\nSeven women founded AEPhi, so it is fitting that seven women at MIT sought to bring a chapter to this campus. These women petitioned the campus Panhellenic on March 31, 1993 for permission to bring a new national sorority to MIT \u2013 AEPhi. The request was denied, but the group\u2019s spirit was not extinguished. They formed a local sorority, Sigma Iota Phi, and made it flourish as a sorority with its own ritual, symbols, and ideals.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Sigma Iota Phi was finally granted permission to go national. The sisters chose to become part of the sorority that the founders had wanted from the beginning \u2013 AEPhi. As the MIT colony, they adopted AEPhi\u2019s ritual and symbols, but kept their same traditions of sisterhood, strength, and dedication. Their second annual \u201cNight at the Improv\u201d raised money for both the local philanthropy and the new national one, the Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Israel. Their initiation, the first AEPhi initiation held on the MIT campus, was conducted on April 9, 1995. By the end of the semester two more members had joined.\r\n\r\nToday the chapter is comprised of an outstanding group of women involved in various extracurricular activities and fields of study. We continue to support the ideals and traditions of both the national sorority and our local chapter.",

Our friendships last beyond college, as sisters reunite at weddings and reunions or live together as they start their careers.\r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves in being well rounded individuals that are leaders in all aspects of campus life.

Each showcase is comprised of 15-20 dances, oftentimes with guest performances by other East Asian groups such as acapella group Syncopasian or the Chinese Ensemble.

In addition to performing works of well-known twentieth-century composers such as Hindemith, Copland, and Schoenberg, the Band has commissioned over 60 pieces for this unique musical genre.",

   "description": "The MIT Concert Choir is a choral group, open by audition to both graduate and undergraduate students, and to members of the MIT community. The Concert Choir works to create an environment where student singers can learn, perform, and contribute to the MIT musical community. By bringing together singers in a social, academic, and performance atmosphere, they hope to expose the MIT community to a wide range of choral music literature and history. \r\n\r\nAs MIT's large student chorus, the Concert Choir performs major works from the standard repertoire each semester, as well as a variety of shorter and lesser-known pieces. The Choir has a rich history originating with the all-male Glee Club in 1884 and continuing with the MIT Choral Society from 1923 until the formation of the Concert Choir under John Oliver in 1989. William Cutter, who came to MIT in 1990 as John Oliver's assistant and rehearsal pianist, assumed the direction of MIT's choral program upon Mr. Oliver's departure in 1996.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the Concert Choir has toured in Budapest, Vienna, and Lausanne, and performed in numerous collaborations with the smaller MIT Chamber Chorus, the MIT Symphony Orchestra, the MIT Wind Ensemble, the choirs of Brown, Tufts and Brandeis Universities, and the orchestras of Tufts University and Wellesley College. In 2002, the MIT Concert Choir was invited to perform with the Boston Pops under Keith Lockhart for MIT's Tech Night at the Pops. Often featuring the finest guest soloists along with student soloists, the student singers of the group regularly expose the MIT community to a wide range of choral music literature.",

Some have become a tradition in themselves. For example, in the Fall, they go on a three-day hiking and foliage trip to New Hampshire or Vermont. They also have a downhill ski weekend in January and a cross-country ski trip in February. In March they pay a visit to the Big Apple (New York). On Memorial Day weekend in May, they drive to Maine or upstate New York for white-water rafting.

In addition, MITFC maintains a library of navigational and instructional materials. Several textbooks, a headset, U.S. sectionals, and airport facility directories are available for members to borrow. While based at MIT, club membership is open to everyone.\r\n\r\nA \u201cloggable\u201d flight simulator is being readied for use by the end of the semester. In addition, MITFC will be holding a flying trip to Cape Cod this April.

MIT GCC will provide future leaders and the international community with a platform to engage each other on topics of global trade, international relations, sustainable development, and cultural exchanges.\r\n\r\nAs China develops a large presence in the international arena, it is crucial to prepare MIT students for professional exchange with the international community. MIT GCC promotes greater awareness and understanding of these issues in the MIT community by means such as publications, general body meetings, professional seminars, delegation visits, international workshops, mentorship, service events, and other educational activities. As one of over 50 chapters established worldwide, MIT GCC is dedicated propelling this mission forward.",

Located in the Religious Activities Center (W11), Hillel has a Jewish library, two kosher kitchens and three dining rooms. These rooms are used at certain times each week for classes, worship, or meetings. The Hillel student body is composed of people from all over the country and the world.\r\n\r\nSocial events, community service, and Jewish learning opportunities are highlights of the Hillel program throughout the year. Hillel's test tube menorah and (now-retired) award-winning student designed sukkah are two examples of the unique community on campus. Hillel's reach expands into the dormitories, fraternities, sororities, with events often being hosted by different Jewish networked-groups. Since graduate students comprise more than half of the MIT student population, Grad Hillel schedules its own diverse events. Our annual Latke-Hamentaschen Debate and nationally-reported-upon Hummus Experience gather students from across campus life. Hillel's Independent Activities Period program, during MIT's four week January term devoted to alternative learning, offers many unique events and classes.\r\n\r\nOther groups such as MIT Students for Israel, the Jewish a cappella ensemble Techiya, and Sloan Jewish Student Organization are active on campus. Hillel also sponsors Art exhibits, a monthly dinner with professors, and a speaker series. Greater Boston is an academic and cultural center attracting thousands of Jewish students to area colleges. MIT students have many opportunities to interact with other students and participate in greater Boston Jewish life.",

The role of the Interfraternity Council executive board is to create proper programming and protocol in order to ensure that our purpose as an organization comes to fruition.\r\nOne of our main goals is to promote interfraternal relations and we do this by creating programming such Greek Week in the spring and the President-Faculty Dinner in the fall. Outside of our IFC Meetings, which mainly involve presidents from every fraternity, we also have a Delegate's Council where we talk about organizational commonalities amongst the fraternities which each person can use to improve their own fraternity.\r\n\r\nAs an organization, we are very structured and have various documents that outline our goals and rules. We have our Constitution that outlines the reason behind our existence as an organization and three main documents that are followed by all our constituents: the Judicial Committee Bylaws, the Recruitment Rules, and the Risk Management Policy.",

   "description": "Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, Kappa Alpha Theta exists to nurture each member throughout her college and alumnae experience and to offer a lifelong opportunity for social, intellectual and moral growth as she meets the higher and broader demands of mature life.\r\n\r\nKappa Alpha Theta was founded at Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle, Indiana on January 27, 1870, making it the first Greek letter fraternity for women. (The word \u201csorority\u201d was not coined until after Kappa Alpha Theta was founded.) Bettie Locke Hamilton was one of the first women admitted to Asbury in 1867, and she believed that uniting with other female students in pursuit of similar goals would greatly enrich their college experience.\r\n\r\nBettie was friends with several Phi Gamma Deltas, and when one of them asked her to wear his pin as a symbol of friendship with the fraternity, she said that she would not unless she could be initiated into the fraternity. Since that was not possible as she was female, she decided that she would start her own fraternity instead.\r\n\r\nShe shared her idea with Alice Allen, Bettie Tipton, and Hannah Fitch, and the four of them together founded Kappa Alpha Theta. Later that year, Kappa Alpha Theta expanded past Asbury, as they established a chapter at Indiana University. In the more than 130 years since, Kappa Alpha Theta has grown to 124 chapters all across the United States and Canada.",

Membership in Pi Beta Phi and the relationships it yields help sisters adapt to college life by providing a sense of belonging, mutual support and guidance.",

After all, we persist yearly on the devotion of a handful of staff members, the gracious support of various humanities departments, and share a small side office with an undergraduate research journal, the news office, and a few other publications. Currently, we're looking to expand our efforts, and we could use your help! \r\n\r\nA literary magazine runs on the strength of the submissions it receives. We are open to submissions of visual or literary art for the the better part of each academic school year though selections are officially broken into two rounds (a fall semester round and a spring semester round). The submissions are reviewed by the staff, and the top pieces are chosen for inclusion in our publication (with all rights retained by authors and artists). \r\n\r\nRune is funded currently by the Undergraduate Association, the Council for the Arts at MIT, and the Program for Writing and Humanistic Studies. In order to continue to serve the MIT community, it has become necessary to expand our funding base. We hope that you will consider contributing to the success of MIT's Literary and Art Magazine. \r\n",

   "description": "Massachusetts Iota Tau, the chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon at MIT, was founded in November 1892 by Harold C. Buckminster, Wallace C. Brackett, Ernest F. Badger, and Frank B. Masters, who were initiated by a member of the newly formed chapter at Boston University, Massachusetts Beta Upsilon. After completion of the first pledge training program, the brothers of Massachusetts Iota Tau held their first initiation at the Woodlawn Hotel in Auburndale, Massachusetts. John Thompson Dorrance, the founder of Campbell\u2019s Soup, was a member of the first pledge class. \r\n\r\nDue to extenuating circumstances, the chapter was closed in 1998. The Phoenix is nothing if not hardy, and thus it was reborn again ten years later in 2008. There was a recolonization attempt in 2003, but those members did not make it and were shut down in 2006. However, members from the first colonization were instrumental in our recolonization; Neil Kelly first contacted Cyrus Vafadari in the fall of 2008, who then passed the word on to two of his friends: Ian Fischer and Davey Hunt. Later, Chase Anderson learned of the opportunity and made the decision to become part of the group as well. The four members worked hard throughout the rest of the year and the summer to develop a strong recruitment schedule, and were successful in bringing three quality individuals into their brotherhood: Ken Cooper, Cory Monroe and Cameron McAlpine. The colony was further successful in spring recruitment, and added to their ranks brothers Nathan Monroe, Teddy Toussaint, and Fernando Cerullo. Growth continued the following semester, with the pledging and initiation of seven new brothers.",

To us, sisterhood means never having to ask for a hug, IMing someone when they are 10 feet away just to say hi, or laughing so hard that you can barely breathe. It means painting your entire face in school colors and cheering on one of your sisters at her championship volleyball game, or spelling out a sister\u2019s name on your stomach because she\u2019s giving a speech at Ring Premiere.

   "description": "Sigma Nu is, first and foremost, a brotherhood. The friendships and memories that are formed here last a lifetime. Fraternity, for us, is about supporting one another and working together to build a richer college experience. For a glimpse of all the great experiences we offer our members, please feel free to browse the rest of our website. We're confident you'll agree that no college experience is complete without the unique and exciting opportunities that Sigma Nu has to offer.\r\n\r\nSigma Nu is one of America's largest fraternities, with hundreds of chapters and hundreds of thousands of brothers at different college campuses across the nation. Founded in 1869 at the Virginia Military Institute, our founders, James Hopkins, Greenfield Quarles, and James Riley were deeply averse to the rampant hazing that is typical at such military institutions, and founded Sigma Nu as an anti-hazing fraternity. Often referred to as the \"Legion of Honor,\" Sigma Nu rests on three core ideals of Love, Truth, and Honor.\r\n\r\nOur chapter's charter date of 1995 makes us one of the youngest fraternities at MIT. In just over a decade, we've built a fraternity full of cool traditions, ambition, and great people. We pride ourselves on being a diverse group of brothers. No matter what your interests, you're sure to find people here who share them.",

Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic community. The concept of networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside the Unites States.\r\n\r\nThe MIT chapter was established in 1987.  Since then, it has grown to over 60 active and 100 general members. Members do not have to be Hispanic or engineering students to participate.  They offer a broad range of opportunities to our members from networking and job opportunities with industry to assistance in the graduate school application process.  They also seek to help others in our community by mentoring middle school school students through the STEM program and encouraging them to pursue higher education, and through other community service work in the greater Boston area.",

Whether you spend your spare time reading about quantum field theory, or you just think that electromagnetism is cool, you would fit in at the Society of Physics Students. We are open to anyone with an appreciation for physics. Whether you have a mild curiosity for the science, or an intellectual passion, our goal is to make you enjoy physics more. We do this in the following ways: 1. Organize social gatherings which are almost always centered around physicists and food. Our events range from weekly lunches with colloquium speakers to our annual Physics Rock Concert. 2. Arrange dinners with your Professors: discuss physics, classes, or current events with your physics professors over dinner at local restaurants, arranged and paid for by SPS. 3. Maintain a Physics Outreach Program: visit local schools to share the excitement of physics by offering demonstrations of topics currently being studied, offer tutoring to the MIT community, and more. 4. We are also a forum which encourages collaboration and communication between students interested in physics, regardless of their interests or level of experience.",

The club was founded with two very important agendas in mind: to provide continued support and training for those already experienced in Taekwondo, and also to introduce and teach the martial art to those who had never tried it before.\r\n\r\nThe club has since exploded in popularity and competitive success, winning the Overall Collegiate National Championship 4 years later, along with 4 consecutive Ivy/Northeast Collegiate Taekwondo League championships. It has become a thriving community of over 50 teamates, athletes and friends... and it's still growing. In 2009, MIT reclaimed the newly renamed ECTC league title from powerhouse Cornell and topped the season off with another Overall Collegiate National Championship title.",

Later, MIT provided an official clarification of the former vague divestment statement, again in large part due to student pressure. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of MIT-STAND are currently two-fold: \r\n1.   To increase awareness of genocide in the Sudan among the student community at MIT via featured events on campus \r\n2.   To work with MIT to design a standing Standing Committee on Investment Responsibility [SCIR] within the corporation framework.",

The organization was launched by graduate students studying science and engineering at universities in the United States with the desire to answer the question, \"how can science and engineering students change the global community.\" The founders recognized the importance of multicultural and interdisciplinary perspectives in addressing contemporary global issues, and became motivated to establish a network where we, the young generation, can exchange ideas on where we can lead the global society and how we individual can contribute to the needs of society's leadership. We then build on that network to take the first steps towards local and global action.",

The club has open practice sessions twice a week which we encourage members to take advantage of. \r\n\r\nEvery Saturday, the club holds an internal tournament which is open to all members. It is held in a Knockout format with the winner receiving a Club Prize (a club T-shirt, Paddle, etc).

Since then, MITATC has grown to offer multiple avenues for tango appreciation and involvement, while connecting dancers both within and outside MIT. The club aims to foster interest for Argentine tango by exposing members of the MIT community to the art and culture of Tango. MITATC also endeavors to provide an accessible and affordable locale for individuals already interested in tango, where tango is taught, learned, practiced, embraced and enjoyed.",

   "description": "Tau Beta Pi (TBP) is the second oldest collegiate honor society in the nation, and the only honor society that represents the entire engineering profession. Founded in 1885 by Professor Edward H. Williams Jr. of Lehigh University, TBP honors those with exemplary character and distinguished scholarship as engineering students and alumni. Both undergraduate and graduate students are invited to become candidates of TBP based on their academic performances, recommendations from faculty, and their contributions to engineering and the society. TBP now consists of 241 collegiate chapters across the United States and Puerto Rico, includes a total initiated membership of almost 501,000. \r\n\r\nThe Mass Beta Chapter of Tau Beta Pi organizes many events on and off the MIT campus to expose those in the Greater Boston community to science/engineering and to introduce MIT students to socially conscious careers. Each year, Tau Beta Pi donates thousands of dollars to the Museum of Science to allow all MIT students enter the museum for free. Tau Beta Pi also organizes the Spring Career Fair that typically occurs during the first week of classes in February to help MIT students and alumni find jobs and internships. Service projects such as SciPro, TBP teach, and Project Fund (TBP Fellowship) are supported by Tau Beta Pi as well.",

Yet, this community finds unity gathered together to hear God's Word and to celebrate the Eucharist.\r\n\r\nOrganizational Structure\r\nIn keeping with our mission, TCC ministries are divided into four categories: Prayer, Service, Education, and Community. The head of each ministry is reponsible for finding organizers for each activity or project which falls within their domain, as well as for facilitating collaboration between the various ministries.\r\n\r\nThe primary governing body of TCC is the Council, which consists of seven members: the Chair, the four Ministry Coordinators, the Undergraduate Member-At-Large (UMAL), and the Graduate Member-At-Large (GMAL).\r\n\r\nThe Council is supported by the Advisory Board, which consists entirely of MIT faculty and staff, including many alumni of TCC. The Advisory Board provides advice, facilitates contact with MIT and the Archdiocese of Boston, and oversees TCC staff.",

One of the earliest programs of its kind in the United States, MIT\u2019s UROP invites undergraduates to participate in research as the junior colleagues of Institute faculty. The late Margaret L. A. MacVicar, Professor of Physical Science and Dean for Undergraduate Education, created MIT\u2019s UROP In 1969, inspired by Edwin H. Land. Land, the inventor of instant photography, believed in the power of learning by doing.\r\n\r\nUROP offers the chance to work on cutting edge research\u2014whether you join established research projects or pursue your own ideas. As UROPers, undergraduates participate in each phase of standard research activity: developing research plans, writing proposals, conducting research, analyzing data and presenting research results in oral and written form. UROP projects take place during the academic year, as well as over the summer, and research can be done in any academic department or interdisciplinary laboratory. Projects can last for an entire semester, and many continue for a year or more. UROP students receive academic credit, pay\u2014either Supervisor Funding or Direct UROP Funding (if a MIT or CME student), or work on a voluntary basis. MIT students use their UROP experiences to become familiar with the faculty, learn about potential majors, and investigate areas of interest. UROPers gain practical skills and knowledge they eventually apply to careers after graduation or as graduate students. Most importantly, they become involved in exciting research!",

   "description": "For many of us, ZBT is the best part of being at MIT. ZBT is non-pledging, which means we don't have a pledge period, and we provide full privileges as a brother as soon as you join. We are the only fraternity in Brookline, a beautiful residential neighborhood with access to local parks, shopping, and great restaurants. Our interests are diverse, our activities are many, and we consider our bonds lifelong. Zebes are sociable, responsible, thoughtful, and always at their brother's side. We hold soirees once a term where brothers and guests enjoy a night of classy music, good company, and elegant desserts made by our chef. And, of course, a Zebe is a gentleman.\r\nAwards",
